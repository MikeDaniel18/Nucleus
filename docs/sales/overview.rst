Sales overview
===============

Crowdsourcer.io as a platform wants to enable you to sell the products of your labour as quickly and easily as possible, offering you multiple ways to earn money. We've tried to cover all circumstances and will strive in the future to offer more and more options for you to earn.

Selling through Crowdsourcer.io
--------------------------------

You can sell directly on Crowdsourcer.io by creating *Products* (see :ref:`selling_your_product`) that will appear on your Project's page and can be purchased by customers. Products can be:

.. rubric:: Serial Keys

Activation keys redeemable on third party websites or in your own application. Learn more about :ref:`Creating serial keys <create_serial_keys>` to understand when to use this product type and get more information setting them up.

.. rubric:: Downloads

A `DRM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management>`_-free file download that customers can download directly. Learn more about :ref:`Creating downloads <create_digital_downloads>` for information on when to use this product type.

.. rubric:: Donations

A product that has no deliverable but can be used to receive donations. See :ref:`Creating donations <create_donations>` for more information on when to use this product type.

Selling via Widgets
___________________

You can also sell the products your create on the Crowdsourcer.io platform, on your own website. You can do this using *Widgets* that take your customers through an (optionally) branded Checkout flow, taking all the hassle out of setting up a store. You won't have to handle any sensitive information nor set up inventory management. All you have to do is copy and paste the generated embed code into your own website. For more information see :ref:`using_widgets`.

.. note:: Using products to make sales either on the Crowdsourcer.io platform, or via widgets on your own site will incur a fee of |shopRate|. This is subject to change and this documentation can quickly become out of date. For a live and up-to-date rate, check the `Support page <https://crowdsourcer.io/support>`_.

Selling with Third parties
---------------------------

If selling through Crowdsourcer.io isn't an option for your business, we've provided the Payroll feature to pay in money collected outside of the platform. Everyone in the project, including the Project Creator, gets paid via this method. Please remember that there are both :ref:`Creator Obligations <creator_obligations>` and :ref:`Contributor Obligations <contributor_obligations>` for projects earning money, that are especially applicable when earning money outside of the platform. 

For more information on how to use the Payroll feature, see :ref:`running_payroll`.

.. note:: Using the Payroll feature to pay yourself and contributors in the project will incur a fee of |payRate|. This is subject to change and this documentation can quickly become out of date. For a live and up-to-date rate, check the `Support page <https://crowdsourcer.io/support>`_.

.. warning:: You are required by the Terms and Conditions of the platform to pay you and your fellow contributors any profits earned outside of the site, through the Payroll system. When a contributor (or project creator) contributes to a project, they do not relinquish their Intellectual Property rights and instead allow the project to use that IP to generate an income, provided that income is paid through the Payroll system. When such a time comes as to be able to log expenses in the Crowdsourcer.io platform, then all externally acquired *revenue* must be paid in via the Payroll system. For more information please see Crowdsourcer.io's `Terms and Conditions <https://crowdsourcer.io/terms>`_.
