Project Creators
=========================

Welcome project creators! We're really excited to see what you come up with and can't wait for you to get stuck in. But we appreciate that there's quite a lot to take in so we've created this knowledge base to provide as much information as we can. Don't forget that the `Project Creation Guide <https://crowdsourcer.io/assets/files/Project%20Creation%20Guide.pdf>`_ has much of the information here, just in a nice fancy booklet focussed on getting you up and running.
