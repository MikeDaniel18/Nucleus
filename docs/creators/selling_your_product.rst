Selling your product
==================================================

You can use Crowdsourcer.io to make sales of the products you make or even to receive donations from people who want to help out financially. All the moeny you earn, whether that from sales, donation or external sources, gets distributed evenly between all contributors. For more information on how money gets split between everyone, see the :ref:`payout_policy`.

How to start selling
--------------------

Once your project has reached 20 C.Pts you'll notice a small notification on the sidebar (if you're the project creator). After clicking the link you'll be taken to a page where you'll be asked to detail the products you're going to sell and how you're going to sell them. Please be as informative as possible as it will help to ensure your application to start selling is accepted quickly. It should not take more than 48 hours before you're accepted, but if you don't receive an email alerting you to this, feel free to resend the form. If there are issues preventing us from enabling sales in your project we'll reach out to you either via the email address you used to register your account or via your project's chat.

Creating products
-----------------

Once your project has been enabled for sales you may start creating products. Products can be sold on Crowdsourcer.io or through your own site using Widgets (Detailed below).
