Introduction to Crowdsourcer.io
===============================

Crowdsourcer.io is a crowd sourcing alternative focussed on software that allows developers and designers alike to either create or join in on software related projects, build up their contribution and earn an income from the final product. Think of Crowdsourcer.io as something between open source software creation and Kickstarter start ups, a new crowd sourcing alternative.

What it does
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Formation

During its early days, projects’ positions are open and can be applied to by prospective contributors meaning as a project creator you can bring in the talent you need to get your project off the ground, and as a contributor, you can become part of some of the coolest new projects around!

.. rubric:: Development

In the development stage, Crowdsourcer.io provides a project management system (aptly named Mission Control) for creating tasks for contributors to complete, communicating with the team and managing the project’s updates, media and positions. As contributors complete tasks they build ‘Contribution Points’ which are the life blood of each project. Gaining contribution points brings managerial permissions to users, voting power and best of all a share of the project’s sales profits! Which brings us to the end goal, selling software.

.. rubric:: Distribution

Crowdsourcer.io provides tools for teams to sell their creations - through the project page, on your own websites and even through external retailers.

Who it's for
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Crowdsourcer.io is for the creative technicals whose talents are often put to waste in their day job. It’s for the hobbyists who can’t make that scary jump of quitting their job and creating a business the ‘normal’ way. It’s for those who would normally create open source products, expecting no financial reward. It’s for those who come up with the best ideas in their bedrooms, on their laptops. Even if you’ve got minimal programming or design/artistic ability, you can still participate in a multitude of other activities that all projects are going to need such as copy writing, translation work or even marketing.

How to use it
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Got a ground breaking idea? Create a project! Projects are what make Crowdsourcer.io worthwhile. We’ve assembled a `Project Creation Guide <https://crowdsourcer.io/assets/files/Project%20Creation%20Guide.pdf>`_ that will help you get through every single stage from inception to going live. Alternatively, keep exploring The Nucleus or jump right in and figure it out as you go along!

Want to help others and build up your own experience? Then start applying to projects that are already live. Complete tasks, build your user approval and hopefully if the project goes well, earn some money for it.

What next?
